version 1.0, 04/13/2010
=======================
- API change: Parser#parse now takes an options hash instead of
  the two boolean arguments.
- Add a :raw format which outputs LaTeX math. You can use this to
  take advantage of Ritex's macro resolution.
- Remove the requirement that only one Parser exist. This has the
  advantage of also making Ritex thread-save.
